# Examples
## See [the documentation](https://bbothell.rocks/popyt/docs).
Here are some basic methods:

Instantiate the object:

```js
const { YouTube } = require('popyt')
const youtube = new YouTube(apiKey)
```

Instantiate the object without caching:

```js
const { YouTube } = require('popyt')
const youtube = new YouTube(apiKey, { cache: false })
```

Get a video by ID:

```js
const video = await youtube.getVideo('dQw4w9WgXcQ')
console.log(video)
```

You can do the same thing with playlists, channels, and comments by replacing `Video` with any of them.  

Get a video by URL:

```js
const video = await youtube.getVideo('https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ')
console.log(video)
```

Get a video by title (or similar title):

```js
const video = await youtube.getVideo('never gonna give you up')
console.log(video)
```

Search videos:

```js
const videos = await youtube.searchVideos('never gonna give you up', 12)
console.log(videos) // array of 12 partial video objects
```

Note: This wrapper does not implement every feature of the YouTube API. With a single developer working on it, there just isn't time for everything to be implemented. Some of the objectively most-important features have been added. The limits imposed by the wrapper are not imposed by YouTube.

# Development/Contributing

* Run `yarn lint`.
